To use porncoind, you must set a rpcpassword in the configuration file:

C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Roaming\Porncoin\porncoin.conf

You will have to make this directory.

Obviously replace <your user> with the username of the user
you are curently logged in as.  For example, if you are
logged in as Owner, the exact location of  the porncoin.conf
file should be:

C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Porncoin\porncoin.conf

An example rpcuser/rpcpassword combination would be:

rpcuser=porncoinrpc
rpcpassword=5DRGskRfsgddG1sNc26npniyXavWjiHXX5WP2KZ4CGm9

(you do not need to remember this password unless you want to solo-mine against this daemon)

If the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions.

An example porncoin.conf file is provided with this distribution.

You will only need to modify the rpcuser/rpcpassword to obtain a working daemon.
